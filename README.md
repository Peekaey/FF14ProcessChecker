# Final Fantasy 14 DND

Small python script that when executed, checks if the process ffxiv_dx11.exe (Final Fantasy 14) is running and will set the system to do not disturb if it is, or vice versa.

Can be executed manually, or be set to run at intervals such as through cron jobs.

Could also be adapted to check for other processes.

_Tested on Ubuntu 20.0.4. Should run on all distro's with a GNOME environment_
